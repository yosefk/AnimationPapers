# AnimationPapers

Snippets for running / variously adapting code implementing animation-related papers.

I prefer to err on the side of publishing ugly code, rather than not publishing code because it's too ugly.
For this kind of code, if you need to change it in order to use it, it's usually better than not having it available at all and starting from scratch.
When people say "I'll publish the code once I clean it up," they're quite likely to never get to it, certainly for "playground"
code of this sort; before long it all fades from memory.
